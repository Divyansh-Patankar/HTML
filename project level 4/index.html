    <h1>About HTMl</h1><hr>

    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) te  hh                                                 xt so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the tex<br><br>

    HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.

    <h1>Mechanical Engineering</h1><hr>

    A mechanical engineer applies principles of physics, mathematics, and material science to design, analyze, and manufacture mechanical systems and devices. These engineers are involved in a wide range of industries, including automotive, aerospace, energy, manufacturing, and robotics. Their primary focus is on creating efficient and reliable machines, equipment, and systems that serve various purposes, from power generation to consumer products.<br><br>

Mechanical engineers play an important role in the entire product development cycle, from concept design and prototyping to testing and production. They use computer-aided design (CAD) software to create detailed models, conduct simulations, and evaluate the performance and structural integrity of their designs. Additionally, they work in multidisciplinary teams to collaborate with professionals from other engineering disciplines to ensure seamless integration of mechanical components into larger systems.
